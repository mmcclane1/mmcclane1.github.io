        <p>
            This semester, I would like to explore how I can combine motion graphics and sound with web development. 
        I will create a functional website that encompasses sound and images that are interactive.  
        My goal is to challenge the boundaries of user engagement with art through these experiments. By 
        blending multimedia elements, I will produce an immersive experience for everyone to enjoy.
